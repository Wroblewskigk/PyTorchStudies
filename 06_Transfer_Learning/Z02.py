Exercise 2: Get the "most wrong" of the predictions on the test dataset and
plot the 5 "most wrong" images. You can do this by:

- Predicting across all of the test dataset, storing the labels and predicted
probabilities.
- Sort the predictions by wrong prediction and then descending predicted
probabilities, this will give you the wrong predictions with the highest
prediction probabilities, in other words, the "most wrong".
- Plot the top 5 "most wrong" images, why do you think the model got these
wrong?
